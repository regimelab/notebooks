In this context, self-organized criticality (SOC) means the market endogenously drifts toward a “critical” configuration where it is marginally stable: most of the time fluctuations are small, but the system is structurally capable of propagating small shocks into large moves through avalanche-like cascades. A low-volatility regime is not necessarily “safe”; in an SOC market it can instead signal that the system has organized itself close to a critical point where sensitivity to exogenous information is heightened, so even modest news can trigger disproportionate volatility. The asymmetry you are interested in is precisely this: volatility *looks* compressed, but the response function to shocks is convex, so the same-sized shock has a much larger impact than in a more “distant-from-criticality” regime.[1][3][5][8]

## SOC and financial markets

- In SOC, complex systems evolve toward a state at the edge of stability and chaos, characterized by fat-tailed event-size distributions and long-range temporal correlations.[3][1]
- In financial markets, this is used to rationalize excess volatility and “small shock, big move” episodes, where local interactions (herding, balance-sheet constraints, liquidity feedbacks) allow small disturbances to percolate through the system.[7][1]

## Low volatility as fragile order

- A period of low realized volatility can correspond to a highly *fragile* configuration if leverage, crowded positioning, or liquidity provision have co-adapted in a way that suppresses day-to-day noise while amplifying rare disturbances.[8][3]
- In SOC-like markets, the system can repeatedly revisit neighborhoods of a critical point, so observed calm may be the surface manifestation of tight coupling and near-marginal stability rather than distance from risk.[5][1]

## Critical transition theory link

- Critical transition theory studies systems approaching tipping points, where early-warning indicators include rising autocorrelation (critical slowing down), increased variance, and skewness changes.[9][7]
- Applied to markets, one looks for persistence in returns or volatility, slower decay of shocks, and changing higher moments as signs the system is approaching a regime where small exogenous information can trigger regime shifts in volatility.[4][7]

## Practical asymmetry indicators

Interpreting your idea operationally, a “sensitive” state would be a low-vol environment that nonetheless exhibits early-warning signatures:

- **Autocorrelation structure**  
  - Elevated lag-1 autocorrelation in returns or volatility, especially when volatility itself is low, can signal critical slowing down: shocks decay more slowly, consistent with proximity to a tipping point.[7][9]
  - Long-memory or slowly decaying autocorrelation in volatility (e.g., high estimated Hurst exponent) during calm periods suggests persistent clusters that can support avalanche-like transitions.[1][4]

- **Distributional and microstructural features**  
  - Power-law-like tails in high-frequency return increments or order-book imbalance statistics, even when daily volatility is low, are consistent with SOC-style avalanche size distributions.[4][1]
  - Thinning order-book depth, higher impact per unit volume, or rising concentration of flow (crowdedness) during quiet regimes indicate the system is more sensitive to news despite suppressed realized volatility.[10][8]

- **Regime indicators from SOC-inspired models**  
  - Agent-based and SOC-style market models show that information contagion and imitation can drive the market toward critical points where small informational shocks cause large price moves.[2][5]
  - In such models, adding a small fraction of more random or less-informed traders, or reducing information intensity, can *lower* fragility, which underlines that “information-rich but calm” regimes may actually be closer to criticality.[2][5]

## Using it as a tool

Conceptually, you can think of your tool as:

- Filtering for regimes where realized volatility is low but:  
  - Short- and medium-horizon autocorrelation in returns/vol are elevated;  
  - Volatility clustering and memory are strong;  
  - Tail indicators and microstructure measures imply high impact per unit shock.  

Those regimes are candidates for SOC-like, **asymmetrically sensitive** states where exogenous information (or modest endogenous shocks) has a higher probability of producing a disproportionate volatility response, consistent with both SOC and critical transition theory frameworks.[3][1][7]
